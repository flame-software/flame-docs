sections:
order: 4

### The next concerns are:
- Explain Flame in greater detail, using the aid of mockups and graphs, under Introduction
- Adding all our Feature Detail blogposts as pages under Specification
- Describing Flame's technical structure, techstack, etc under Specification
- Writing a public Whitepaper detailing Flame's journey under Company
- Writing an about and history under Company
- Detailing Flame's profit model under Company

Our top priority is transparency, and that is why we made this Documentation website not to just explain how Flame's application will work, but also what our company is and how we intend to run everything.
