We are botch software engineers who are gonna devolep the Flame application. If we need any help we want to ask it to the community. In our community are many different kinds of people with their own skills. So if we want help of some one then we can ask it to them. We want no employees who needs to get paid, because we can't afford that at the moment and we believe that we can build the application by our selfs, with the help of our community.
