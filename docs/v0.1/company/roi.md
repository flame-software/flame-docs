# Introduction <a name="{sections[0]}"></a>

As a social platform, Flame will have to look into the future to ensure the platform's survivability. As we've seen in the past platforms can potentially explode in size in relatively small amounts of time, and Flame needs to be ready for that phase to ensure it does not bleed money and leave its userbase in the dust. That is why we are publicizing this ROI Summary publicly to transparently communicate the company's profit intentions.

This ROI is an analysis of our estimated costs and profits 5 years from now. We are assuming a situation in which Flame has approximately 1 million active registered users across its network, including usercounts on instances not managed by Flame. Based on figures from the Mastodon network, which is a similar connected social platform, we estimate that with 1 million total users Flame's official instance will have 50 to 100 thousand users. However because Flame will have a primary client as opposed to Mastodon's more neutral website based approach we believe Flame's instance will be more commonly chosen and used, meaning we expect around 200 thousand of the 1 million users to be registered at and use our main instance.

Important to note is that this ROI is an estimation of our business situation 5 years from now, and the situation can evolve completely differently than expected leading us to make business decisions in the favor of Flame's stability and our userbase's benefit that stray from this plan.

# Identifying costs <a name="{sections[1]}"></a>

We have identified the following potential cost categories for Flame:

- Hiring costs and employee salary on Software Engineers helping develop Flame's various open-source and proprietary components.
- Administrative costs related to management, government compliance and administration.
- Support, safety and moderation staff to keep our official instances safe and enforce network rules.
- Bounty payouts for vulnerability and bug reports.
- Server hosting costs for processing user requests and storing data.
- Marketing related to brand awareness, business events and similar.
- Employee cost unrelated to salary such as insurance, business trips, and similar.
- Resource and Development costs related to necessary tools and services needed during development such as IDEs, Licenses, GitHub Actions, etc.

# Identifying revenue streams <a name="{sections[2]}"></a>

With our currently outlined business model, we estimate the following are potential revenue streams for Flame:
- Early premium subscription model subscribers.
- Merchandise sales through a branded store.
- Sales through our first-party marketplace.
- Internal advertising sales profits.
- B2B managed instance hosting for businesses.

# Estimating costs <a name="{sections[3]}"></a>

Hiring costs and employee salary on Software Engineers helping develop Flame‚Äôs various open-source and proprietary components. $450.000 a year. We can indicate this because of the median salary of senior and junior programmers.

Administrative costs related to management, government compliance and administration. $250.000,- a year.

Support, safety and moderation staff to keep our official instances safe and enforce network rules. $350.000,- a year.

Bounty payouts for vulnerability and bug reports. $20.000,- a year. Google pays like $2.000,- when a vulnerability is found. As Flame we like to do the same. When someone finds a vulnerability they will be rewarded if our cash flow will allow it.

Server hosting costs for processing user requests and storing data. $24.576,- a year. This is calculated with the Google calculater tool.

Marketing related to brand awareness, business events and similar. $34.218,- a year. This will include advertisement costs.

Employee cost unrelated to salary such as insurance, business trips, and similar. $85.240,- a year.

Resource and Development costs related to necessary tools and services needed during development such as IDEs, Licenses, GitHub Actions, etc. $10.000,- a year.

# Estimating revenue <a name="{sections[4]}"></a>

## Early premium subscription model subscribers

For subscriptions revenue we will be estimating it using our closest comparison: Discord.
According to publicly available reports, Discord had 10 million users and made 5 million US Dollars in total revenue in 2016. Discord's profit model is almost solely based on their premium subscription, and the pricing of their subscription is similar to what Flame intends to offer. At the time, Discord's premium subscriptions did not have that many features and the company was not pushing the service.

In 2021 Discord had 140 million new registered users and their total revenue was 130 million US Dollars, this is presumably because of the company's push towards their premium subscription. Even though these numbers are more favorable, we will be using the 2016 figures to better reflect how Flame is a starting business with fewer features available and fewer users.

Profit on subscriptions can only be calculated in relation to the amount of users on our main instance, not the entire network, as we have no direct control over whether instances promote and offer our subscription to their users.

Leading from these figures, a rough estimation will land us at 1 million US Dollars in profits annually.


## Merchandise sales through a branded store

Though present, we expect profits from merchandise to be insignificant to our revenue as it involves costs with production, research, shipping and customer support. We expect the brand awareness and passive advertising as a result of the sale of merchandise to be more important for the company.


## Sales through our first-party marketplace

The revenue coming from the Marketplace can be calculated for the entire 1 million user, as our marketplace will be available to all users from all instances in the network.

In 2022 Flame conducated a survey where we asked people whether they would buy or sell items on our hypothetical Marketplace. About 25% of our potential customers said they would consider buying stickers or themes.

As seen throughout game stores like Steam or the App Store and places with microtransactions like mobile games, a user who buys once is likely to buy again. Because of this we can estimate that on average users who are willing to purchase items from the store, given there is enough incentive and new enticing items to buy, will purchase an item worth around 10 dollars every few months. From this we find that the Marketplace is able to generate at least 1,25 million US Dollars of revenue annually for the company when using a 10% margin on items, or 2,5 million US Dollars annually with a 20% margin.

The idea of the profitability of the Marketplace is further backed by the ecosystem of one of our main competitors, Discord. Discord recently released their "App Directory" and "Server Subscriptions" to rival the existing ecosystems of free and paid bot websites and premium server access usually done through platforms like Patreon. These are concepts similar to Flame's Marketplace but in a much more limited fashion. Whilst there are no public figures available yet, the involvement does signify that Discord finds that there is money to be earned in this segment.

We believe that Flame's marketplace 5 years from now is able to generate at least 2 million US Dollars of revenue annually for the company.

## Internal advertising sales profits

In 2019 Google earned 160 billion US Dollars primarily from advertising to over 1 billion users worldwide. It is notable that Google has sophisticated methods backed by AI and innovation to make their users more likely to click or watch advertisements.

Flame will be able to display relevant advertising inside the Marketplace or other areas of our clients, but we don't expect everyone to use our primary clients and for some to seek to disable these advertisements. According to public records about 26,4% of users used an adblocker in 2020 and this amount grows every year. However we believe that it will be some time before our users develop their own ad-free clients and that the act of installing alternative clients will remain uncommon for a while, so we expect that at least 80% of our users will be exposed to internal ads.

Using this we can optimistically estimate that Flame will generate 128 million US Dollars from ad sales annually. But we must adjust for our lower priority and frequency of showing ads to users, our less sophisticated methods of ad personalization and being less attractive to major advertisers due to being a smaller platform. With this in mind we realistically expect no more than 5 million US Dollars in annual ad sale revenue.

## B2B managed instance hosting for businesses

For B2B instance hosting, we look to companies doing similar things such as Nextcloud, which is a cloud service developing a cloud program for free and profits by offering paid hosting called Nextcloud Enterprise. Nextcloud is interesting to businesses for being independent and open source, similar reasons to why we expect businesses want to run their own Flame instances.

In 2021 Nextcloud generated 2 million US Dollars in revenue. Even though we believe that for this reason B2B can make for a good asset in Flame's revenue, we will not estimate a figure in this ROI Summary because we do not believe that at this stage of Flame's development enough companies will be interested in B2B managed hosting to make a significant contribution to our revenue.

# Conclusion and footnotes <a name="{sections[6]}"></a>

When it comes to a Return on Investment, we operate under an assumption that we do not want or need to get grants, investments or loans to operate Flame. Due to our open-source nature we believe it can sustain itself under any load with its revenue growing in tandem with costs. For this reason, there is little investment up front needed. Though there is still a long timespan before Flame will generate return due to its long development period. However this development can largely be done by our founders and open source contributors.

As can be seen by our balance sheet, advertisements make up a large portion of our expected revenue in 5 years from now as they do on a lot of free-to-use services. This ROI makes it clear that whilst a paid subscription model can help us cover costs in early stages it is essential that we explore advertising related venues as soon as we have the capacity and amounts of data needed to do so.

Being free is important to Flame to gain traction with the masses as well as promote our vision of a better internet. We believe ad sales will always remain a large portion of our revenue, though we do expect the Marketplace's piece of the pie to only keep increasing as Flame's userbase grows and the value of its items keeps increasing.

It should be noted that our premium subscription model is not intended to exist permanently because we believe all features should be accessible for free. Although we don't intend to get rid of it at such an early stage, it will be on our radar as something to do as soon as we are no longer dependent on it for stability and the long term innovation of Flame.

This balance sheet also shows us that Flame can be profitable and self sustainable with as few as 1 million total users thanks to its lower employee count as a result of being largely open source and the fact that other parties are covering part of the server costs because we are a connected network of instances.
