## Why is Flame different  <a name="{sections[1]}"></a>

Flame is diffent from our competitors because we focus on an customisable platform that a user can form to his own will. Also every other chat platform can be integrated in Flame. So if you want to switch to Flame because it is awesome but your friends are not that awesome, no problem! You can chat with them on Whatssapp from Flame.








## Flame as a product <a name="{sections[2]}"></a>

The future product of Flame Software will be an chat platform.
Because Flame is an chat platform it is hard to discribe. That is why we make a weekly mockup of how Flame could look like. Here are some examples:
