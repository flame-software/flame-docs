# Current state of human communication online <a name="{sections[1]}"></a>

Boiled down to its basic components, there are two primary types of ways to communicate on the internet:
- A social media, a platform where people can share stuff, usually publicly.
- A chat platform, a place where people can communicate between smaller groups of people, usually in real time.

We should identify some of the industry's current platforms into our categories:
- Twitter, a social media, content is mostly public and generally not real time.
- Facebook, a social media, all sorts of public content.
- Facebook's Messenger, the primary goal is to send real time messages between users.
- Traditional forums, a social media, data is usually not shared real time and is focused on providing information publicly.
- Discord, a chat platform and social media, data can be shared in servers with millions of users, but is generally focused at smaller real time communication.

The current state of internet communication is as follows.
Users may register on a platform, which shares details about them to that platform like an email address or name, and requires a password be given to that platform for authorising.
When authorised, users may perform actions on the platform, such as view or make posts, comment, like, or whatever else the platform features.
All of these platforms act mostly independently and have differing featuresets. Twitter focuses on short strips of content, Instagram mostly does photo or video content, Facebook tries a mix of all of it.

# Identifying the problem <a name="{sections[3]}"></a>

Currently the industry has 3 major problems for customers:
- They are static and inversatile, places like Discord do this better but comes with its own tradeoffs.
- Everything is either a social media OR a chat app, and both get used around with the other creating friction.
- Moving providers kills your connection with all of your contacts on a platform, adding group pressure and preventing innovation in new platforms.

There are a multitude of second tier problems as well, some of which mentioned below:
- Privacy concerns.
- Data is not forever, can be deleted or lost on bankruptcy or according to GDPR compliance rules.

We won't zoom into these problems in this paper, as we consider to be widely covered and understood and less important to customers than our initial points.
